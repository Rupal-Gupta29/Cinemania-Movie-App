# Cinemania
I've developed a web app called Cinemania using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router DOM for client-side navigation. Cinemania utilizes the TMDB API to fetch and display the latest, top-rated, upcoming, and popular movies and TV shows. Key features include:

1. Adding movies or shows to a favorites section.
2. Searching for movies or shows based on various criteria.
3. Viewing detailed information about selected movies or shows, including ratings, cast, release date, seasons, durations, and genres.
4. Watching available trailers on YouTube.
5. Browsing content by genres.
6. Pagination for browsing fetched data.
7. Responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across all devices

These features provide a comprehensive and engaging experience for users to explore and enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
